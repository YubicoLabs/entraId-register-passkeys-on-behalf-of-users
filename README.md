1. New Feature: Automated PDF Generation
Description: Script 2 automatically generates a detailed PDF for each registered user, including:

Custom logo (optional).

User details (name, email, registration date).

YubiKey specifics (PIN, serial number).

Usage instructions and security notes.

Organized output folder based on group name (group_name).

Technologies Used: reportlab library for PDF creation, os for path management.

2. Enhanced User Interface
Verbose and Intuitive Output:

Emojis (üîë, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå) for immediate visual feedback.

Professionally translated messages in Italian (e.g., "‚ùå No YubiKey detected! Please check...").

Improved Error Handling:

Specific error messages (e.g., YubiKey not detected, connectivity issues).

3. Strengthened PIN Management
Dedicated warn_user_about_pin_behaviors() function for PIN behavior warnings.

Logic for random PIN generation (similar to Script 1), but with clearer user prompts (e.g., warnings about PIN changes).

4. Technical and Structural Improvements
Code Modularity:

Separated functions for PDF creation (create_pdf()) and user registration logic.

Correct HTTP Headers:

Use of OAuth 2.0 standard (Bearer {access_token}) for API requests.

Extended Configurations:

Added group_name for file organization and logo_path (hardcoded but expandable).

5. Minor but Meaningful Differences
CSV Header Formatting: Improved clarity with #upn labels.

Hybrid Language Use: Mix of Italian/English in messages with professional tone (e.g., "YubiKey-Zugangsdaten" in PDF titles).
